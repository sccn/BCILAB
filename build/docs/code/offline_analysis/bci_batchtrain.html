 Results = bci_batchtrain(Datasets,Approaches,PredictSets,LoadArguments,TrainArguments,SaveArguments,StoragePattern,ResultPattern,ProcessingOrder,ReuseExisting,DefaultName,ErrorHandler,ClusterEngine,ClusterPool,ClusterPolicy)

 This function is a convenience wrapper around bci_train and bci_predict. It can be used to apply
 an approach systematically to a range of data sets (e.g. those matching a file name pattern on disk).
 It can also be used to compare a series of approaches on one or more data sets.

 Essentially all of the functionality of bci_train and bci_predict is supported also in this function,
 so that the majority of offline analysis procedures can be applied with a single call to bci_batchtrain.
 A special feature of this function is that it stores the final results in a standard directory
 in a user-accessible form, and that it can optionally resume a cancelled batch computation by reusing
 existing results -- which is the recommended way to ensure that no data is lost in case of a crash.

 A streamlined approach to batch analysis involves first &quot;curating&quot; the raw source data sets in a script
 or by hand (e.g., ensuring that the desired markers are present or that the channel locations are 
 well-formed), then defining a series of approaches to be compared, and finally invoking bci_batchtrain
 on the directory containing the curated data sets.
 
 In:
   --- core arguments ---

   Datasets : Data sets to process (train/cross-validate). Cell array of file names, file name 
              patterns, or dataset structs.

   Approaches : Approach(es) to use. Same format as in bci_train. If multiple approaches should be
                applied, this may also be a struct, each of whose fields specifies another approach
                to use (where the field name identifies the name of the respective approach as
                used in this function's output).

   PredictSets : Optional data sets on which to predict BCI outputs using bci_predict; must yield 
                 one set for each set in Datasets (if specified in the same format as Datasets),
                 or, if multiple  predict sets are given for each data set (e.g., multiple test
                 sessions), must be a cell array of one cell array with test sets per each training
                 set.

   --- optional data pipeline customization ---

   TargetMarkers : Target markers. List of types of those markers around which data shall be used
                   for BCI calibration; each marker type encodes a different target class (i.e.
                   desired output value) to be learned by the resulting BCI model. 
                   
                   This can be specified either as a cell array of marker-value pairs, in which
                   case each marker type of BCI interest is associated with a particular BCI output 
                   value (e.g., -1/+1), or as a cell array of marker types (in which case each 
                   marker will be associated with its respective index as corresponding BCI output 
                   value, while nested cell arrays are also allowed to group markers that correspond
                   to the same output value). See help of set_targetmarkers for further explanation.

   LoadArguments : Optional load arguments. Additional arguments to io_loadset - given as a cell
                   array (e.g. {'channels',1:32}). (default: {})

   TrainArguments : Optional training arguments. Additional arguments to bci_train - given as a
                    cell array (e.g. {'eval_scheme', {'chron',5,5}}). (default: {})

   PredictArguments : Optional prediction arguments. Arguments to bci_predict - given as a cell array.

   SaveArguments : Optional save arguments. Additional arguments to io_save - given as a cell array.
                   If saving is slow or your files are frequently corrupted due to multiple workers 
                   saving simultaneously, you might consider also passing the option -serialized.
                   (default: {'-makedirs'})


   --- optional output formatting ---

   StudyTag : Tag of the performed study. May be used to identify/distinguish stored results on disk 
              (see StoragePattern). Default: 'default'.

   StoragePattern : Result storage pattern. This is a filename pattern with optional placeholders
                    %caller (subtituted by the calling function''s name), %set (substituted by
                    the respective file name or data set number that generated the result),
                    %approach (substituted by the respective approach name), and %study (substituted
                    by the StudyTag). Default: 'home:/batchtrain/%caller-%study/%approach-%set.mat' 
                    Note that home:/ is the user's home directory; consider that the disk quota in 
                    a user's home directory may be limited.

   ResultPattern : Result output pattern. This is a MATLAB expression with optional placeholders
                   %approach (substituted with the respective approach name), %num (substituted
                   with the number of the respective data set) and %caller (substituted by the
                   calling function's name). (default: 'results.%approach(%num) = ')

   DefaultName : Default approach name. If only a single approach was given as a cell array rather
                 than as a struct with subfields. (default: 'default')

   --- optional computation organization ---

   ProcessingOrder : Processing order. Either go through all sets first for one approach, then for
                     the next, etc. (setsfirst), or go through all approaches for the first set,
                     then for the next set, etc. (approachesfirst). Since some approaches may take
                     orders of magnitude longer than others (perhaps unexpectedly), it is often the 
                     best idea to specify aproaches in order of assumed running time, and use 
                     the 'setsfirst' order. (default: 'setsfirst')

   ApproachProcessingOrder : run over approaches in the given order; can be used to ensure that k 
                             machines work on different job, by passing the numbers 0..k-1 
                             to different instances of bci_batchtrain (default: 0/false)

   DatasetProcessingOrder : run over data sets in a different order; can be used to ensure that k 
                             machines work on different job, by passing the numbers 0..k-1 
                             to different instances of bci_batchtrain (default: 0/false)

   ReuseExisting: reuse existing results if the respective output files already exist on disk 
                  (default: false)

   ClusterResources : Cluster computation engine. If set to local, parallel processing is effectively 
                      turned off. If set to global, the global BCILAB setting is used
                      (par_globalsetting), if set to BLS the BCILAB scheduler is used, and if
                      set to ParallelComputingToolbox, the MATLAB PCT is used. Reference is for
                      testing. (default: 'global')

   ClusterPool : Cluster resource pool. If set to global, the global BCILAB setting 
                 (par_globalsetting) will be used. Otherwise, this is a cell array of
                 hostnames (and optionally ports) of remote worker processes. (default: 'global')

   --- miscellaneous ---

   ErrorHandler : Error handler to use. Function handle or name that takes a struct as generated by
                  lasterror(). (default: 'auto' = 'hlp_handleerror' if running locally and 'rethrow' 
                  if running remotely)

   LoadOnly : Only load, not recompute, any results; can be used to re-load past results quickly
              (default: false)

   CacheLoaded : Cache loaded results, so loading them the next time will be faster.
                 (default: false)

   ApproachRestrict : restrict the approaches to those in the given set (if approaches is given as 
                      a struct with one field per approach, this is a cell array of field names)
                      (default: {})        

 Out:
   Results: result structure, as constructed by the Result pattern, with a sub-struct for each data
            set assigned to it. The sub-struct for each data set has the following fields:
            'loss' : same as the loss output of bci_train
            'model': same as the model output of bci_train
            'stats': same as the stats output of bci_train

            if PredictSets were specified, additional fields will be present:
            'pred_loss'  : same as the loss output of bci_predict
            'pred_stats' : same as the stats output of bci_predict
            'pred_predictions' : same as the predictions output of bci_predict
            'pred_targets': same as the targets output of bci_predict

   Errors : cell array of error objects produced during the run (particularly when running on a cluster);
            this will be empty unless the ErrorHandler rethrows the errors (see ErrorHandler).

 Notes:
   Expect to be tempted to interrupt long-running computations. In this case, you will have to read
   the data from disk -- so it is generally a good idea to not disable the StoragePattern.

 Examples:
   first define some approach for subsequent use
   myapproach = {'CSP', 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[0 3.5]}}};

   % apply the given approach to all files named subject*.vhdr, in the directory studyX (assuming 
   % that the events of interest are called 'S1' and 'S2').
   results = bci_batchtrain('studyX/subject*.vhdr',myapproach,[],{'S1','S2'})

   % apply the given approach to a list of file names
   results = bci_batchtrain({'studyX/subject1.vhdr','studyX/subject2.vhdr','studyX/subject3.vhdr'},myapproach,[],{'S1','S2'})

   % as before, but now using name-value arguments, and passing some additional io_loadset arguments (assuming we want to process only the first 32 channels)
   results = bci_batchtrain('Datasets',{'studyX/subject1.vhdr','studyX/subject2.vhdr','studyX/subject3.vhdr'}, 'Approaches',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'S1','S2'}, 'LoadArguments',{'channels',1:32})

   % apply the given approach to a list of pre-loaded data sets
   results = bci_batchtrain({myset1,myset2,myset3},myapproach,[],{'S1','S2'})

   % apply the given approach to a list of pre-loaded data sets, but pass some special bci_train arguments to expedite processing using only a 3-fold cross-validation
   results = bci_batchtrain({myset1,myset2,myset3},myapproach,[],{'S1','S2'},{'EvaluationScheme',{'chron',3,5}})

   % as before, but using name-value arguments and disabling output into the home directory
   results = bci_batchtrain('Datasets',{myset1,myset2,myset3}, 'Approaches',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'S1','S2'}, 'TrainArguments',{'EvaluationScheme',{'chron',3,5}}, 'StoragePattern','')

   % as before, but instead disabling the output as a MATLAB variable (perhaps to not exhaust the memory)
   bci_batchtrain('Datasets',{myset1,myset2,myset3}, 'Approaches',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'S1','S2'}, 'TrainArguments',{'EvaluationScheme',{'chron',3,5}}, 'ResultPattern','')

   % again using 3 filenames, but this time also using 3 different approaches
   myapproaches.simpleCSP = 'CSP';
   myapproaches.advancedSpecCSP = 'SpecCSP';
   myapproaches.experimentalCSP = {'CSP', 'Prediction',{'FeatureExtraction'{'PatternPairs',10},'MachineLearning',{'Learner',{'logreg',[],'variant','vb-ard'}}}};
   results = bci_batchtrain({'studyX/subject1.vhdr','studyX/subject2.vhdr','studyX/subject3.vhdr'},myapproaches,[],{'S1','S2'})
