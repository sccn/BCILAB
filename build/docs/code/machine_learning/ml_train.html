 Model = ml_train(Data, Arguments)

 This function dispatches, depending on the first cell in Arguments, to one of the
 machine_learning/ml_train* functions (e.g., ml_trainlda, etc.), and may perform some additional
 data formatting depending on inputs and outputs. It is to be preferred over calling the ml_train*
 functions directly (especially since some callees may rely on the additional work done by
 ml_train).

 The function is the general tool to be applied when a predictive model shall be learned from a
 (usually unstructured, but labeled) set of trials [1,3]. Each trial is typically fed to the
 function as a vector of previously extracted features (called a feature vector), as a generic
 format understood by a large variety of different methods [2]. Each trial typically has a label
 (or target value), which may be categorical (a number out of a small set of numbers), real-valued
 (or continuous: any number), multivariate (a vector of numbers), or structured (an arbitrary
 cell). If empty labels are supplied, the goal is usually not to predict any labels, but to learn
 the probablity distribution of the supplied data.

 The resulting predictive model (usually a MATLAB struct()) is termed, depending on the label type,
 a 'classifier', 'regressor', or 'density estimator'. It captures in its parameters the necessary
 information to be able to predict the desired target value from a new instance of data (assumed to
 originate from the same distribution as the training data). It is sometimes called the 'predictive
 function', and the term 'model' is also frequently used in the literature to refer to classes of
 such functions (with free parameters).

 Chosing the right method for a given task is a difficult problem, and requires correct assumptions
 about the structure of the data, and often further experimentation. The toolbox provides a
 relatively broad set of methods from different branches of machine learning, among others
 statistics (lda,qda,logreg), optimization (svm*,logreg,dal), support vector machines
 (svmlight,svmlinear,svmperf,rvm), (Bayesian) probability theory (gmm,logreg,rvm) and meta-learning
 (vote). Prominent fields currently not covered are neural networks, fuzzy inference, and
 evolutionary methods.

 The ml_train* functions are named according to the fundamental approach, but typically several
 variants are provided by each, which themselves may have multiple parameters and which may be
 implemented with different libraries. The overall approach can often be chosen based on
 assumptions about the data, whereas some parameters may have to be selected by parameter search
 (preferred for reasons explained in offline_analysis/bci_train), or are otherwise adapted. In the
 context of the toolbox, it is usually not enough to select the right learning function, but
 instead, the entire data pipeline, usually starting with signal (pre-)processing, followed by
 feature extraction and concluded by machine learning needs to be determined. Extensive fully
 customizable default setups (&quot;paradigms&quot;) are provided at higher levels (paradigms/para_*,
 offline_analysis/bci_train).

 In:
   Data    :   * either a cell array of {Trials} or {Trials, Targets} or {Trials, Targets,
                 Weights}, with 
                 - Trials a [NxF] numeric array (N... number of training instances,
                   F... number of feature dimensions) or a [UxVxWx...xN] Nd array in special cases 
                   (N... number of training instances, U,V,W,... feature tensor dimensions).
                   If not otherwise possible, it is allowed to pass trials in any custom
                   format, as long as it is being recognized by the machine learning function of
                   interest.
                 - Targets one of the following:
                    * a [NxT] array (N... number of training instances, T... number of target 
                      dimensions, T usually 1)
                    * a {N} cell array (N... number of training instances, contents unspecified)
                      ... in this case, the method selected in Options must support structured 
                      prediction
                    * an empty array, indicating that the probability density of the input data is 
                      to be estimated
                    * a cell array describing a set of probability distributions, either discrete
                      or continuous (see ml_predict for examples)
                 - Weights a [Nx1] numeric array of non-negative per-trial trial weights (N...
                   number of training instances)
               * or, alternatively, a cell array of {{[N1xF],[N2xF], [N3xF], ...}}, with
                   Ni the number of instances for class i (possibly empty)
                   F the number of feature dimensions

   Arguments :   cell array of further arguments for learning the model; The first argument in
                 Options is considered the name of the learning method, e.g. 'lda', 'logreg', and
                 specifies the ml_train&lt;name&gt; learning function to be called all other options are
                 passed unmodified into the learning function
 Out:
   Model   : predictive model, can later be used in conjunction with ml_predict
              Model.args is the arguments to ml_train
              Model.model is the predictive model returned by the appropriate ml_train* function
              where applicable,
                 Model.model.b is the bias
                 Model.model.w is the weights

 Examples:
   % assuming a feature matrix for 160 trials a 10 dimensions, and a corresponding label vector
   % size(trials) -&gt; [160,10]; size(targets) -&gt; [160,1]

   % learn LDA predictor from some training data
   model = ml_train({trials,targets},{'lda'})

   % learn GMM predictor with some additional parameters
   model = ml_train({trials,targets},{'gmm' 0.4 'xxx'})

   % learn SVM predictor for three-class data in trials1/2/3
   model = ml_train({{trials1,trials2,trials3}},{'svm'})

   % learn GMM density estimator
   model = ml_train({trials,[]}, {'gmm'})

   % special: re-parse the list of supported plugin functions (affects GUIs displayed for ml_train)
   ml_train('update')

   % apply the learned model to some data
   % predictions = ml_predict(model,trials)

 Notes:
   Weighted learning is only supported by a fraction of the ml_train* functions.
