 Model = ml_traindal(Trials, Targets, Lambda, Options...)

 The Dual-Augmented Lagrangian method [1] is an efficient and very robust approach to learning
 regularized linear classifiers or regressors, particularly for &quot;noisy&quot; biosignals. The
 regularization is very effective, so that a large number of features (e.g. every channel and time
 point) can be supplied for learning. Assumptions about how features are correlated or independent
 w.r.t. each other can (and should) be incorporated, by specifying the appropriate type of
 regularizer. If features are known to be all uncorrelated (e.g. derived from indepenent
 components), 'l1' is the appropriate regularizer. If features are correlated only within blocks,
 'glr'/'glc' (group lasso by rows or columns) is the appropriate regularizer, e.g. time points of
 concatenated independent components. If features are all correlated, but it is understood that
 there when arranged in a feature matrix, the correlation structure would be low-rank, then 'ds' is
 the appropriate regularizer. The 'ds' mode is ideally suited when features are a matrix of
 time-points by channels, where both time-points are mutually correlated and channels are, too, or
 when the features are covariance matrices, etc.

 To inform the classifier of the block size for 'glr'/'glc' or the matrix shape for 'ds', the
 trials should either be supplied as a 3d matrix (i.e. feature matrices instead of feature
 vectors), or supplied in the regular fashion (2d matrix of feature vectors), but with the intended
 feature matrix shape specified in the 'shape' option. A few methods with different
 performance/accuracy/datasize tradeoffs are supplied. An important consideration when using DAL is
 that the data must be appropriately normalized for the method to be most effective, that is, it
 must be normalized across features and/or groups in 'l1' and 'glc'/'glr' modes, and normalized
 across both the horizontal and vertical axes of the feature matrix, and/or across blocks of a
 block-diagonal feature matrix, in the 'ds' mode.

 BCI paradigms which make extensive use of this classifier, according to [2], are provided in the
 paradigms/para_dal* functions. Among the methods provided in the toolbox, DAL is likely the best
 applicable method if the data is linearly separable (albeit not necessarily the easiest to use).

 In:
   Trials       : training data, as in ml_train
                  in addition, it may be specified as UxVxN 3d matrix,
                  with UxV-formatted feature matrices per trial (N trials), or
                  as {{U1xV1,U2xV2,...}, {U1xV1,U2xV2,...}

   Targets      : target variable, as in ml_train

   Lambda       : sequence of regularization parameters to evaluate; (default: 2.^(4:-0.25:-3))

   Options  : optional name-value parameters to control the training details:
              'loss': loss function to be used,
                        'squared' for regression
                        'logistic' for classification (default)

              'regularizer': type of regularization to use:
                             'l1': l1-norm on the features, gives sparse results
                             'glr': grouped l1 norm (&quot;group lasso&quot;), gives blockwise sparse results
                                   (groups the rows of the feature matrices)
                             'glc': grouped l1 norm (&quot;group lasso&quot;), gives blockwise sparse results
                                   (groups the columns of the feature matrices)
                             'ds': dual spectral norm, gives low-rank results (default)
                             'en': elastic net norm, employs a combination of l1 and l2 regularization

              'shape': if trials is a NxF 2d matrix of vectorized matrices,
                           this is the dimensions of the matrices (default: Fx1)
                       if trials is specified as an UxVxN 3d matrix, shape defaults to
                           [U,V] and trials are vectorized into the regular [N, U*V]
                       if shape is specified with one of the values being NaN,
                           that value is set so that prod(shape)==F==U*V

              misc parameters:
              'scaling': pre-scaling of the data (see hlp_findscaling for options) (default: 'none')

              'nfolds' : Cross-validation folds. The cross-validation is used to determine the best 
                         regularization parameter value (default: 5)

              'foldmargin' : Margin (in trials) between folds. This is the number of trials omitted 
                             between training and test sets. (default: 5)

              'cvmetric' : metric to use for parameter optimization; can be any of those supported by
                           ml_calcloss (default: '' = auto-determine)

              'bias': whether to include a bias term (default: 1)

              'quiet': whether to suppress diagnostic outputs (default: 1)

              'solver': solver to be used:
                         'cg'   : Newton method with preconditioned conjugate gradient descent (default)
                         'qn'   : Quasi-Newton method (slower, but uses less flimsy code...)

 Out:
   Models   : a predictive model

 Examples:
   % assuming a 3d feature array of size UxVxT, and a label vector of size Tx1
   % the features should be appropriately normalized (see [2] for examples)

   % learn a DAL model for a given regularization parameter using the logistic loss (for classification)
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1)

   % as before, but use the squared loss, for linear regression
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'loss','squared')

   % like before, but this time use the 'l1' (LASSO) regularizer, assuming sparse features
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'regularizer','l1')

   % like before, but this time use the group LASSO regularizer imposing group sparsity on the rows
   % of the feature matrix (columns is 'glc')
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'regularizer','glr')

   % like before but use the (default) dual-spectral regularizer, which learns low-rank weights
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'regularizer','ds')

   % if the individual trials are not matrix-shaped but vectorized, pass in the shape manually
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'shape',[U,V])

   % use a different solver (here: conjugate gradient, which is potentially more efficient)
   model = ml_traindal(trials,targets,0.1,'solver','cg')

   % learn a DAL model using a parameter search
   model = utl_searchmodel({trials,targets},'args',{{'dal', search(2.^(10:-0.5:-6))}})
   
   % as before, but use a different loss
   model = utl_searchmodel({trials,targets},'args',{{'dal', search(2.^(10:-0.5:-6)), 'loss', 'glc'}})
