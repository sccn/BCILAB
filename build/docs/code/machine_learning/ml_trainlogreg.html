 Model = ml_trainlogreg(Trials, Targets, Lambda, Options...)

 Logistic regression is the simplest fully probabilistic classifier in the toolbox, and can be
 understood as a linear projection followed by a mapping through a sigmoid (0-1) function, which
 allows to translate the input space smoothly into probabilities. Logreg is available in several
 variants, first the three variational Bayes (vb) ones, which are not dependent on a regularization
 parameter [1]. 'vb' and 'vb-iter' are about as versatile as LDA, except that they are fully
 probabilistic and not as outlier-prone; they differ mostly in numerical robustness. 'vb-ard' uses
 automatic relevance determination [2] to obtain a mapping that is sparse in the features, i.e.
 only a subset of the features is used for prediction. The Bayesian implementations compute not
 only a point estimate of the weights, but a full posterior distribution (gaussian), which enables
 more advanced post-processing of the model and outputs.

 The l1/l2 variants are computed via convex optimization. They might generally be somewhat more
 robust in extreme corner cases than the variational variants. Both require that a regularization
 parameter is specified, which can in simple cases be left at the default, but which is ideally
 optimized using parameter search, especially in the presence of many features and/or
 hard-to-handle distributions (more important for l1 than l2). This is computationally expensive,
 however. The 'l2' variant is the general-purpose one and in practice very similar to the
 vb/vb-iter variants. The 'l1' variant uses an l1-norm on the weights as regularizer and therefore
 gives a model that is sparse in the features (like vb-ard).

 A particularly fast implementation that is equivalent to l1 is LARS (least-angle regression) [7], 
 which is generally to be preferred for sparse results, when speed is an issue and the binary is 
 executable.

 Logistic regression is a very powerful, robust and versatile classifier for biosignals, and also
 very fast (when not regularized) - it is worth trying it on almost every problem that is hoped to
 be (more or less) linearly separable. Sparse logistic regression is a special case which allows to
 select features (out of exponentially many irrelevant ones) [3,4] on top of doing classification.
 EEG-derived feature are however in most cases not sparse, so that l1 or vb-ard may give worse
 results. Exceptions are features derived from independent components and other sparsity-inducing
 feature extractors. Some signal bases (e.g. wavelets) may be half-way in between sparse and
 non-sparse.

 The Bayesian variants are implemented using the bayes_logit toolbox by Jan Drugowitsch, and the
 regularized variants are implemented using the LIBLINEAR package [5] or CVX [6] as a fall-back.

 In:
   Trials       : training data, as in ml_train

   Targets      : target variable, as in ml_train
                  may also contain weights, in the form {Targets,Weights}; supported by l1 &amp; l2 variants

   Lambda       : regularization parameter, for l1/l2 logistic regression variant (default: 1)
                  a comprehensive search interval would be 2.^(-6:0.5:10)

   Options  : optional name-value parameters to control the training details:
              'variant': one of several logreg variants:
                        'vb': variational Bayes (Jakkola&amp;Jordan, 2000), using a joint uninformative
                              prior on the weights, but possibly numerically unstable in corner cases (default)
                        'vb-iter': variational Bayes (Jakkola&amp;Jordan, 2000), iterative, using a per-weight prior,
                                   more or less uninformative, but numerically more robust than the 'vb' variant
                        'vb-ard': variational Bayes (Jakkola&amp;Jordan, 2000), implements sparse logistic regression
                                   (using automated relevance determination)
                        'lars' : using least-angle regression (efficient version of 'l1', using GLMNET)
                                 note: this can also be specified as a cell array of the form 
                                 {'lars', name,value, name,value, ...} where the names and values 
                                 specify custom options for the glmnet solver.
                        'l1' : sparse logistic regression using l1 regularization, using either 
                               LIBLINEAR or CVX
                        'l2' : logistic regression using l2 regularization using LIBLINEAR
                       

              'eps'    : desired accuracy (default: [] - the default of the respective library, currently only supported for l1/l2)

              'scaling': pre-scaling of the data (see hlp_findscaling for options) (default: 'std')

              'regression' : do binomially-distributed regression as opposed to binary classification (default: false)

 Out:
   Model   : a linear model;
             w is the linear weights, b is the bias;
             V is the covariance matrix of a posterior distribution around the weights (jointly over w and b)
               (only available for the three 'vb' modes)
             classes indicates the class labels which the model predicts
             additional parameters determine a posterior distribution over the weights

 Examples:
   % learn a logistic regression model using a fast Bayesian method
   model = ml_trainlogreg(trials,targets)

   % as before, but using a numerically more robust (yet slower) approach
   model = ml_trainlogreg(trials,targets,[],'variant','vb-iter')

   % learn a sparse Bayesian logistic regression model 
   model = ml_trainlogreg(trials,targets,[],'variant','vb-ard')

   % learn a sparse regularized logistic regression model using LARS
   model = ml_trainlogreg(trials,targets,[],'variant','lars')

   % as before, but use a different number of inner cross-validation folds for LARS.
   model = ml_trainlogreg(trials,targets,[],'variant',{'lars','NumFolds',10})

   % learn a sparse regularized logistic regression model using a relatively less efficient approach
   model = utl_searchmodel({trials,targets},'args',{{'logreg',search(2.^(-6:1:10)),'variant','l1'}})

   % learn a regularized logistic regression model (using cross-validation)
   model = utl_searchmodel({trials,targets},'args',{{'logreg',search(2.^(-6:1:10)),'variant','l1'}})
