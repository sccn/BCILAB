<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Create a new data stream, and set up meta-data.
 Id = onl_newstream(StreamName, Options...)

 After a stream has been created, blocks of data can be appended to it using onl_append().
 Predictors can be linked to the stream using onl_newpredictor(), and their predictions (given the
 stream's most recent contents) can be queried using onl_predict(). One can alternatively also get
 the most recent k seconds of raw data via onl_peek() or set up a filter pipeline using
 onl_newpipeline() and then query the most recent k samples of filtered data using onl_filtered().
 This stream API is the basis for all online processing plugins (see code/online_plugins/*), as
 well as for the pseudo-online simulation function onl_simulate().

 A stream has almost the same layout as an EEGLAB dataset struct; particularly, all the meta-data
 (such as .srate and .chanlocs) is exactly the same. The difference is that a) the stream holds
 only the last n seconds of data and markers that were appended (since all read operations on it
 refer to portions of the most recent data), and b) markers and data are not in the regular EEGLAB
 format for efficiency reasons (see Notes for internal details).

 All name-value pairs that are specified in the Options are added as fields to this data structure.

 In:
   StreamName : name of the stream; a variable with this name will be created in the MATLAB workspace 
                to hold the stream's data. If such a variable already exists it will be overridden.

   Options... : meta-data fields that are to be included in the stream, given as name-value pairs. 
                A struct with meta-data (e.g., a dataset), may also be specified.

                * 'srate' : the sampling rate, in Hz, of the stream (mandatory)

                * 'chanlocs' : per-channel meta-data ('locs' is due to the EEGLAB heritage);
                               struct array with fields
                                 .labels : channel name (mandatory)
                                 .type   : channel type (typical types are EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, GSR,
                                           Gaze, ECoG, NIRS, MoCap)
                                 additional domain-specific fields (e.g., X,Y,Z coordinates for EEG 
                                 channels may be added)
                               can also be a cell array of strings, which are then assumed to 
                               represent the channel labels

                * 'xmin' : optional time, in seconds, of the first sample in some arbitrary clock 
                           domain; if non-zero xmin's are specified for multiple streams that are 
                           being processed by the same predictor, they must be all in the same
                           domain. If time stamps are supplied during onl_append the xmin/xmax 
                           are re-adapted consistently with the time stamps. (default: 0)

                * 'types' : cell-string array of type(s) of the stream data (default: union of the 
                            channel types); this can be utilized to declare that a stream carries
                            data of some types even though no proper channel labels are available,
                            which allows for lax fallback matching of streams and filter chains
                            of predictors in the absence of channel labels

                * domain-specific additional fields, such as icawinv, dipfit, or ref

                Additional online-specific fields:

                * 'buffer_len' : maximum length of the signal buffer, in seconds (default: 10).

                * 'marker_buffer_len' : maximum number of marker records held in the marker buffer
                                       (default: 1000).

                * 'timestamps_len' : number of time stamps that should be averaged to yield a signal 
                                     lag estimate, if time stamps are supplied online during onl_append
                                     (default: 25)

 Out:
   Id : a unique id number for the predictor; same as StreamName.streamid


 Notes:
   For efficiency, the storage layout for the stream's data is not an array that goes from the
   first sample to the last, but rather a circular buffer where data wraps around; to avoid
   confusion, the stream has empty .data and .event fields. Instead of .data, it has a .buffer
   field (a circular buffer that holds the most recently added n seconds of data) and .smax (the
   number of samples appended so far, which is used as an index into the ring buffer, using
   wrap-around indexing). Instead of .event it has a field .marker_buffer (circular buffer of
   marker structs), .mmax (number of marker records appended so far and serving as wrap-around
   index into .marker_buffer), and lastly .marker_pos (sparse time series that holds indices into
   .marker_buffer; like .buffer, the .marker_pos time series is a circular buffer). Please avoid
   using these fields directly -- instead always use the functions onl_append and onl_peek to
   read/write to the stream since the internal format may change (also, fields need to be accessed
   in the correct order to support concurrent read/write operations from timers).

   The stream can be distinguished from a regular EEGLAB dataset by having the additional fields
   'buffer' and 'smax'. smax indicates how many samples have been appended to the stream so far 
   (though only the most recent subset of them is held in the buffer).

   If 'clear' is run in the workspace, the stream will be erased.

 Example:
   % calibrate (or load) a model
   mydata = io_loadset('data:/projects/attention/mason.bdf');
   [loss,model] = bci_train({'data',mydata, 'approach',myapproach});
   
   % create a new online stream
   onl_newstream('mystream','srate',200,'chanlocs',{'C3','Cz','C4'});
   % create a new predictor from a model
   onl_newpredictor('mypredictor',model);

   while 1
       % obtain a new block of data from some acquisition system
       datachunk = get_new_samples();
       % feed the block into the online stream
       onl_append('mystream',datachunk);
       % obtain predictions
       outputs = onl_predict('mypredictor');
       % display them
       bar(outputs); drawnow; pause(0.1);
   end
