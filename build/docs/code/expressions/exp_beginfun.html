 General
 =======
 If a function uses exp_beginfun/exp_endfun, MATLAB code that uses these functions does not &quot;call&quot;
 them in an imperative manner, but instead builds symbolic expressions that can be stored,
 transmitted, or manipulated before/if they are being evaluated. Evaluation is generally done via
 exp_eval() (or exp_eval_optimized()). Almost all uses of exp_beginfun by functions look like this:

   function [res1,res2,...] = my_function(arg1,arg2, ...)
   if ~exp_beginfun('somesetting') return; end

   ... &lt;actual implementation&gt; ...

   exp_endfun;
 
 ... where 'somesetting' specifies the behavioral setting for the function. Generally, all
 functions that operate on data sets and modify the signal content in a way that needs to be
 replicated online have the setting 'filter', and all functions that have no equivalent during
 online processing (e.g., marker transcription) have the setting 'editing'. Functions that do
 processing that cannot be reproduced online have the setting 'offline'. See filters/flt_* and
 dataset_ops/set_* for some examples. A setting is a shortcut name for an assignment of attributes
 associated with the function declaration (attributes can also be directly specified to
 exp_beginfun).


 Filter and Editing Functions
 ============================
 Functions of type 'filter' should be written just like regular EEGLAB signal processing functions
 (i.e., they receive a data set and some options, and produce a transformed version of the data
 set), but functions that are supposed to be usable online should be &quot;chunkable&quot;, i.e. they should
 produce the same sequence of output samples when they are called for consecutive segments (chunks)
 of the data set. Thus, the function should dump its internal state in an additional output (the
 'state' variable) and be able to resume from this state when called on the next chunk. Chunks may
 well be just a single sample long. During online processing, state will be passed in automatically.

 In some cases, this strict behavior would be prohibitively inefficient - in this case, the
 function may refrain to non-adaptive behavior if the chunks are too short. In particular, in
 BCILAB, it may be assumed that each filter is first called on a complete calibration data set in a
 single call, and is then either called on a complete test data set in one call (the next 'chunk'),
 or piecemeal on small blocks of an incoming online stream. ICA, for example, adapts itself only on
 the calibration data set (i.e. the first chunk) and uses that decomposition for all remaining ones
 (i.e. during online use).

 Functions of type 'editing' should be written just like regular EEGLAB data set editing functions
 (e.g. pop_chanedit), BUT they must not change the data or srate fields.

 Rationale/Background
 ====================
 For the purpose of data processing function declarations, the exp_beginfun/exp_endfun contract
 handles the book-keeping necessary to be able to reproduce the filter (and entire filter chain)
 1:1 online, and offers additional functionality, such as transparent caching of results (for later
 near-instantaneuous retrieval) and the annotation of all data sets with an executable expression
 which, when invoked, reproduces the data set 1:1, as well as checks to guarantee that no invalid
 &quot;tampering&quot; is done by the user on data sets (such as running a forward-backward filter in EEGLAB 
 or manually scaling the data). 

 In its general form, the functions exp_beginfun/exp_endfun are part of the machinery that enables
 symbolic computation in MATLAB (in the style of Mathematica), and the
 'filter'/'editing'/'symbolic'/'annotate'/'default' argument is a short-cut which selects default
 attributes of the function being defined (which can be overridden). Some of these attributes are
 customizable plugin &quot;slots&quot; (plugins to be applied to each argument or all inputs or all outputs
 of the function being defined). 'Filter'/'editing' imply such hooks as default attributes, which
 in turn implement the tamper-proofing checks and some post-processing on the emitted data sets.
 The post-processing adds fields (subfields of the .tracking field) to the (otherwise arbitrary)
 data set structs that are produced by the function being defined, most importantly the
 .tracking.expression, which is an executable (recursive) expression representation which mirrors
 each data set in symbolic form, and .tracking.online_expression, in the case of filters, which
 defines the arguments to be used for the respective filter during online processing. These
 operations are usually completely transparent to the user (and locked away in the .tracking
 field), and make it exceptionally simple to author components for the toolbox.

 The symbolic-computation functionality implemented by the expressions/exp_* functions is largely
 non-overlapping with what the MATLAB Symbolic toolbox offers: the Symbolic toolbox exclusively
 implements mathematics (e.g. derivatives, integrals, simplifications), while the expression system
 of BCILAB exclusively implements expression manipulation, such as substitution, pattern matching,
 hashing, memoization, and reflection. These facilities allow to implement very high-level behavior
 in functions such as bci_train, such as generic programming (e.g. utl_crossval, utl_searchmodel,
 utl_gridsearch being non-intrusively adapted to EEG sets, STUDY sets, etc.), optimizations (e.g.
 in-memory caching and on-disk caching of intermediate results, computational shortcuts, and more
 in the future), with relatively little coding effort.

 While, by default, a function is invoked online with the same parameters that were used for
 offline processing (aside from a 'state' parameter for stateful functions), it is is possible to
 specify that certain parameters should have different values during online processing. This is
 enabled by the attribute 'append_online' (list of arguments to be appended in the online case),
 which can be specified either to exp_beginfun or exp_endfun. Alternatively, the entire expression
 can be subsituted by setting the 'set_online' attribute (expression to use during online
 processing).

 In:
  AttributeSetting: baseline attribute assignment for the function; must be specified. Below are
                    typical scenarios:
                    * defining a function that should not evaluate immediately, but only after
                      evaluation by an exp_eval() clause:
                      'default' : delayed execution, input fingerprint checks

                    * defining a function that processes data sets and should have
                      delayed-evaluation semantics:
                      'filter'  : functions that do non-trivial processing of data sets, and which
                                  should support online replication of some offline processing;
                                  attributes: delayed (1), add_impure (1), set_online
                                  ('reproduce'), also performs EEGLAB-aware input data set checks &amp;
                                  transforms note: when an offline processing is replicated online,
                                  the function is called successively on short EEGLAB data sets,
                                  with inputs identical to the input parameters as they were
                                  snapshot after execution of the function's body (by exp_endfun)
                      'editing' : functions that do processing of data sets which has no equivalent
                                  in online processing, i.e. which pass the input data through
                                  unmodified; attributes: delayed (1), add_impure (1), set_online
                                  ('passthrough'), also performs EEGLAB-aware input data set checks
                      'offline' : functions that do processing of data sets which cannot be
                                  reproduced online; these generate an error, when used within
                                  online BCIss; attributes: delayed (1), add_impure (1), set_online
                                  ('inapplicable'), also performs EEGLAB-aware input data set
                                  checks

                    * defining a function that performs purely symbolic manipulations of
                      expressions:
                      'symbolic': all inputs are held unevaluated, associated (impure) values are
                                  ignored (thus no fingerprinting and no memoization); attributes:
                                  delayed (1), hold ('all'), fingerprints unchecked &amp; passed
                                  through, memoize (0)
                                  note: symbolic functions cannot be used in online code.

                    * defining a function that performs immediate (non-lazy) processing of data
                      structures, and which shall have their results annotated with an executable
                      (repeatable) description of the processing performed:
                      'annotate': delayed (0), add_impure (1)


   Attributes... : optional name-value pairs to refine attributes of the function being defined:

                     'delayed'   : whether the function has delayed-evaluation semantics, i.e. it 
                                   doesn't evaluate unless passed to exp_eval (default: 1)

                     'hold'      : []/'all'/'first'/'rest'; whether to leave all/the first/the
                                   remaining arguments or no arguments of the function unevaluated
                                   before executing the function body (useful for higher-order
                                   functions), (default: [])

                     'symbolic'  : whether the function being defined should be evaluated even if it
                                   receives unevaluated expressions as arguments (ignoring those
                                   arguments that fall under hold) - this is for symbol-manipulating
                                   functions that can process unevaluated expressions (0/1, default: 0)

                     'add_impure': integrate the original expression into the function value (when
                                   evaluated), creating an 'impure expression', 0/1

                     'set_online': Relevant only when the settings attribute is 'filter', 'editing'
                                   or 'offline', may also be specified in exp_endfun. Introduces an
                                   'online expression' into the function value (when evaluated),
                                   which is a record of how the resulting data (usually a signal)
                                   should be calculated online. Usually, this is identical to how
                                   the filter is applied offline.
                                   * 'passthrough': the function is skipped in the online
                                                    processing
                                   * 'reproduce': the function is called online with the same arguments
                                                  as in offline processing
                                   * 'inapplicable': the function gives an error when used in
                                                     online processing
                                   * {arg1, arg2, arg3, ...}: the given arguments will be used as
                                                              function arguments during online use
                                   * expression: the given expression will be used during online
                                                 reproduction of the filter

                     'append_online' : {arg1, arg2, arg3, ...}: the given arguments will be
                                       appended to the function arguments during online use
                                       (default: [])

                     'argsteps', 'presteps', 'poststeps' : advanced attributes, see also &quot;Advanced
                                                           Functionality&quot; section.

                     'delayed_online' : whether this function has delayed-evaluation semantics
                                        during online processing (default: false)

 Out:
   Evaluate     : whether the body of the function being defined shall be evaluated or skipped


 Advanced functionality:
   The allowed settings are customizable/extensible via the function <a href="exp_settings.html" class="code" title="function defaults = exp_settings(setting)">exp_settings</a>, which maps a
   setting string onto a cell array of default attributes (name-value pairs).

   During evaluation, each input argument is sent though a customizable sequence of functions,
   which can be specified via the 'argsteps' attribute (as a cell array). Further, the attriutes
   'presteps' and 'poststeps' are cell arrays of functions that should be invoked before and after
   the function body runs, respectively; they operate on a context structure, which is defined
   further below. These built-in attributes are the primary mechanism by which custom <a href="exp_settings.html" class="code" title="function defaults = exp_settings(setting)">exp_settings</a>
   add functionality to exp_beginfun/exp_endfun (e.g., annotating a dataset with an expression or
   checking fingerprints).

   The function's behavior can be controlled via dynamically scoped variables, as set by <a href="exp_block.html" class="code" title="function res = exp_block(rules, expr, iters)">exp_block</a>,
   <a href="exp_set.html" class="code" title="function res = exp_set(lhs,rhs) %#ok<STOUT>">exp_set</a> and <a href="exp_setdelayed.html" class="code" title="function res = exp_setdelayed(lhs,rhs) %#ok<STOUT>">exp_setdelayed</a>, or correspondent attributes in <a href="exp_beginfun.html" class="code" title="function should_evaluate = exp_beginfun(setting, varargin)">exp_beginfun</a>.
     These variables can be assigned values, such as 0/1, but may be arbitrary expressions
      * fingerprint_check: toggle per-argument fingerprint checking (default: true) - may use
        @expression to refer to the argument expression, to implement expression-dependent checking
      * fingerprint_create: toggle fingerprint creation (default: true) - may use @expression to
        refer to the unevaluated complete expression, to implement expression-dependent checking
      * memoize: selectively enable memoization; this is a cell array of the form
        {location,expression,location,expression, ...}. location can be either 'disk' or 'memory',
        expression should evaluate to true/false, may use @expression to refer to the unevaluated
        complete expression, to implement expression-dependent memoization.
