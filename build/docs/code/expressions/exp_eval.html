 Out-Args = exp_eval(Expression, Iterations)

 exp_eval operates on data structures that represent expressions, and evaluates them. The canonical 
 expression data structure is of the form:
  struct
    .head: function_handle
    .parts: cell array
  
 This structure represents the expression head(parts{:}). Expression data structures can be nested,
 and can have their value attached, if that value is a struct (they can have a &quot;payload&quot;, in a
 sense). In this case, they are structured in the form:
  struct
    .whatever_fields_belong_to_the_value
    .tracking: struct
      .expression: the actual expression data structure

 This way, EEG and STUDY data sets can be regular value types and expressions at the same time,
 which allows to annotate EEGLAB data sets with an expression which (uniquely) identifies them, and
 which reproduces them. Expressions are created by some of the expressions/exp_* functions, and by
 functions using the exp_beginfun/exp_endfun contract (i.e., BCILAB filters and data set editing
 components). For this reason, a call like io_quickload('/data/test.set') or
 flt_resample(eeg,[],200) do by default return an unevaluated expression data structure, which must
 be evaluated first (using exp_eval()), to get access to its value. In other words,
 exp_eval(io_quickload('/data/test.set')) gives the EEGLAB data set. This can be viewed as &quot;lazy&quot;
 evaluation. BCILABs framework functions (bci_train, bci_predict, bci_preproc, etc.) do this
 implicitly and automatically.


 In:
   Expression : an expression
   Iterations : maximum number of repeated evaluations applied (default: 1)
                for real symbolic computations, pass Inf here

 Out:
   Out-Args   : the result of the evaluation, may still be unevaluated if the expression could not
                be completely evaluated

 Notes:
   For the purposes of exp_eval(), every data structure that can be expressed in MATLAB is an 
   expression.
   * Almost all data structures, however, are considered to be 'literal' (and atomic) expressions,
     such as numbers, strings, function handles, but also recursive data structures, such as cell
     arrays and structs. These literals cannot be further evaluated. Therefore, almost all MATLAB
     expressions produce literal expressions, such as, for example, fft(randn(100,1)).

   * A subset of expressions, however, yields by default data that represents unevaluated (or
     partially evaluated) expressions. Such expressions are formed using either functions that
     follow the exp_beginfun/exp_endfun protocol, or symbols introduced using exp_symbol or
     exp_declare. The bulk of these expressions &quot;evaluate&quot; into structures with the two fields
     'head' and 'parts', where 'head' is a function_handle and 'parts' is a cell array. The purpose
     of exp_eval() is to fully evaluate these unevaluated expressions, by applying the head to the
     parts (&quot;calling&quot; the function head with parts as its arguments, in MATLAB terms).

   * To ease interaction with other MATLAB code, some expressions may retain, after having been
     evaluated (into a MATLAB structure), a subfield that holds the original unevaluated expression
     that reproduces the data when re-evaluated. These expressions are called &quot;impure&quot; expressions,
     because they can be viewed both as an unevaluated expression and an evaluated expression. They
     can thus be processed both by expression-oriented code, and by code that expects values.

 Usage Notes:
   * any MATLAB function can be converted into one that is not immediately evaluated, by adding the
     two lines &quot;if ~exp_beginfun() return; end&quot;, and &quot;exp_endfun;&quot; to its definition, before and
     after the remaining code.
   * using exp_symbol, exp_declare_symbols, or @name_of_no_defined_function, arbitrary identifiers
     can be introduced which are not immediately evaluated (but some of which could be evaluated by
     exp_eval, given that function code and/or values are defined for them).

 Further Reading:
   A good way to understand symbolic expressions and the operations on them is to read the
   Mathematica online documentation. The expression system shares some commonalities with
   Mathematica, with the following considerations:
    * A subset of functions is implemented with analogous semantics, where SomeFunction is called
      exp_somefunction in MATLAB
    * MATLAB has a larger palette of atomic expressions (in addition to String, Number, Symbol, it
      has Value, which reflects structs, matrices, etc.) In the future, more builtin data structure
      may be reflected as List, SparseArray, etc.
    * () are used instead of [], and most operators, such as //., :&gt; cannot be expressed in MATLAB,
      so that their functional forms must be used.
    * symbols must be formally introduced before use (with exp_declare_symbols), or expressed
      either as exp_symbol('x') or as @x
    * expressions of the form f(a)(b) cannot be interpreted by MATLAB. The workaround is
      x=f(a);x(b).
    * expressions are not automatically evaluated; this must be done explicitly with exp_eval().
      also, the evaluator implemented here is less aggressive, and can be invoked for a limited
      number of steps.
    * for the implementation of functions, the exp_beginfun/exp_endfun prologue-epilogue pattern is
      available.

 Examples:
   % evaluate a dataset-loading expression
   eeg = exp_eval(io_loadset('/data/projects/test.set'))

   % write up a sequence of filter steps, and finally evalate it; note that, if this particular
   % sequence had been executed previously, and was cached on disk, the result will be directly 
   % retrieved from the disk cache
   eeg = io_loadset('/data/projects/test.set')
   eeg = flt_resample(eeg,200)
   eeg = flt_iir(eeg,[0.5 2],'highpass')
   eeg = exp_eval(eeg);
