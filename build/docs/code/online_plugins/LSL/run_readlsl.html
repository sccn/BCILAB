 run_readlsl(MatlabStream,SelectionProperty,SelectionValue,UpdateFrequency)

 This plugin connects to and receives data from a device on the lab streaming layer. The data source
 is specified by means of a query (some allowed properties are type, name, channel_count, and srate).

 In:
   StreamName : name of the stream; a variable with this name will be created in the MATLAB workspace 
                to hold the stream's data. If such a variable already exists it will be overridden.

   DataStreamQuery : Data stream query. Allows to select an LSL data stream to read from (e.g., by setting 
                     it to 'type=''EEG''' or 'name=''BioSemi'''). (default: 'type=''EEG''')

   MarkerStreamQuery : Marker stream query. Allows to select an LSL marker stream to read from (e.g., by setting 
                       it to 'type=''Markers'''). Leave it empty to ignore markers. (default: 'type=''Markers''')

   ConvertToDouble : Always convert the signal to double precision. (default: true)
   
   UpdateFrequency : The rate at which new chunks of data is polled from the device, in Hz. 
                     (default: 20)

   BufferLength : Internal buffering length. This is the maximum amount of backlog that you can
                  get, in seconds. (default: 30)

   ChannelOverride : Override channel labels. This allows to replace the channel labels that 
                     are provided by the stream. (default: {})

   SamplingRateOverride : Override sampling rate. This allows to replace the sampling rate that is
                          provided by the stream. (default: 0)

   MarkerPlacement : Marker placement rule. Controls how the latency of markers is determined --
                     can use fractional placement, which is based on the sampling rate (potentially
                     the most precise, but requires that the sampling rate is well within 1% of the
                     true value) or placement next to the nearest sample (also works for streams
                     that have irregular sampling rate). (default: 'nearest')

   ClockAlignment : Clock alignment algorithm. The algorithm used to smooth clock alignment
                    measurements; if the clock drift between data and markers is assumed to be low
                    (e.g., come from same machine), then median is the safest choice. If drift is
                    substantial (e.g., on a networked installation) then one may use linear to
                    correct for that, but if the network is under heavy load it is safer to use
                    the trimmed or robust estimators. The trimmed estimator survives occasional
                    extreme load spikes, and the robust estimator further improves that tolerance
                    by 2x. The only issue with the robust estimator is that whenever it updates
                    (every 5s) it delays the BCI output by an extra 15ms of processing time. Zero
                    disables the time-correction. (default: 'median')

   JitterCorrection : Correct for jittered time stamps. This corrects jitter in the time stamps of
                      the data stream chunks assuming that the underlying sampling rate is regular
                      but may drift slowly. (default: true)

   ForgetHalftime : Forget factor as information half-life. In estimating the effective sampling rate 
                    a sample which is this many seconds old will be weighted 1/2 as much as the
                    current sample in an exponentially decaying window. (default: 30)

 Notes:
   The general format of the queries is that of an XPath 1.0 predicate on the meta-data of a given stream.

   Some older versions of MATLAB (solved since 2009a) cannot handle a sender disconnecting while
   run_readlsl is running; on those versions you need to clear (i.e., stop) the stream before you
   disconnect at the sender side, otherwise your MATLAB will hang.

 Examples:
   % receive data from a device that contains gaze data
   run_readlsl('mystream','type','Gaze');

   % read from an EEG stream (default) but use custom channel labels
   run_readlsl('ChannelOverride', {'C3','C4','Cz','O1','O2'};

   % read from a stream that has the name 'PhaseSpace'
   run_readlsl('SelectionProperty','name','SelectionValue','PhaseSpace')
