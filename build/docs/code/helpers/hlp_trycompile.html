 OK = hlp_trycompile(Options...)

 This function tries to ensure that a given set of functions or classes (specified by their
 MATLAB identifier), whose source files are assumed to be located in a given directory, are
 properly compiled.

 The Style parameter determines how the function proceeds: Either compilation is always done
 ('force'), or only if necessary ('eager', e.g. if invalid file or changed source code). The check
 for re-compilation may be done on every call ('eager'), or once per MATLAB session ('lazy').

 The most common use case is specifying a given directory (and omitting the identifiers). In this 
 case, all source files that have a mexFunction declaration are compiled, and all other source 
 files are also supplied to the compiler as additional files. In case of compilation errors,
 hlp_trycompile also tries to omit all additional files during compilation. Both the list of 
 additional files (or their file name patterns) or the considered file types can be specified. The 
 list of identifiers to consider can also be specified.

 Another possible use case is to omit both the identifiers and the directory. In this case, 
 hlp_trycompile assumes that a mex file with the same identifier (and path) as the calling function
 shall be compiled. This is would be used in .m files which directly implement some fallback code
 in case that the compilation fails (or which are just stubs to trigger the on-demand compilation).


 Since there can be many different versions of a mex binary under Linux (even with the same name),
 .mex files are by default moved into a sub-directory (named according to the hostname) after
 compilation. This does not apply to .class files, which are not platform-specific.

 The function supports nearly all features of the underlying MEX compiler, and can thus be used
 to compile a large variety of mex packages found in the wild (in some cases with custom defines,
 libraries, or include directories).

 If you are debugging code with it, it is best to set Verbose to true, so that you get compilation 
 output.

 Additional features of this function include:
  * Figures out whether the -largeArrayDims switch should be used.
  * Repeated calls of this function are very fast if used in 'lazy' mode (so that it can be used in 
    an inner loop).
  * Automatically rebuilds if the mex source has changed (does not apply to misc dependency files),
    if used in 'eager' mode.
  * By default uses the Mathworks versions of BLAS and LAPACK (if these libraries are pulled in).
  * Supports both '/' and '\' in directory names.
  * Behaves reasonably in deployed mode (i.e. gives warnings if files are missing).
  * Also compiles .java files where appropriate.
  * Supports test code.

 If this function produces errors for some mex package, the most common causes are:
  * If the platform has never been used to compile code, an appropriate compiler may have to be 
    selected using &quot;mex -setup&quot;. If no supported compiler is installed (e.g. on Win64), it must 
    first be doenloaded and installed (there is a free standard compiler for every platform).
  * Some unused source files are in the directory which produce errors when they are automatically 
    pulled in.
    --&gt; turn on verbose output and identify &amp; remove these (or check the supplied make file for 
        what files are actually needed)
  * The functions require a custom define switch to work.
    --&gt; Check the make file, and add the switch(es) using the 'Defines' parameter.
  * The functions use non-standard C code (e.g. // comments).
    --&gt; Tentatively rename the offending .c files into .cpp.
  * The functions require a specific library to work.
    --&gt; Check the make file, and add the libraries using the 'Libaries' parameter.
  * The functions require specific include directories to work.
    --&gt; Check the make file, and add the directories using the 'IncludeDirectories' parameter.
  * The functions require additional files that are in a different directory.
    --&gt; Check the make file, and add these files using the 'SupportFiles' parameter. Wildcards are 
        allowed (in particular the special '*' string, which translates into all source files in 
        the Directory).
  * The package assumes that mex is used with the -output option to use a custom identifier name
    --&gt; This type of make acrobatic is not supported by hlp_trycompile; instead, rename the source
        file which has the mexFunction definition such that it matches the target identifier.
  * The functions require specific library directories to work.
    --&gt; Check the make file, and add the directories using the 'LibraryDirectories' parameter.


 In:
   Style : execution style, can be one of the following (default: 'lazy')
           'force' : force compilation (regardless of whether the binaries are already there)
           'eager' : compile only if necessary, check every time that this function is called
           'lazy'  : compile only if necessary, and don't check again during this MATLAB session

   --- target files ---

   Directory : directory in which the source files are located
               (default: directory of the calling function)

   Identifiers : identifier of the target function/class, or cell array of identifiers that should
                 be compiled (default: Calling function, if no directory given, or names of all
                 compilable source files in the directory, if a directory is given.)

   FileTypes : file type patterns to consider as sources files for the Identifiers
               (default: {'*.f','*.c','*.cpp','*.java'})


   --- testing conditions ---

   TestCode : MATLAB code (string) which evaluates to true if the compiled code is behaving
              correctly (and false otherwise), or alternatively a function handle which does the
              same


   --- additional compiler inputs ---

   SupportFiles : cell array of additional / supporting source filenames to include in the compilation of all
                  Identifiers (default: '*')
                  Note: Any file listed here will not be considered part of the Identifiers, when
                        all contents of a directory are to be compiled.
                  Note: If there are support source files in sub-directories, include the full path
                        to them.
                  Note: If this is '*', all source files that are not mex files in the given 
                        directory are used as support files.

   Libraries : names of libraries to include in the compilation
               (default: {})

   IncludeDirectories : additional directories in which to search for included source files.
                        (default: {})

   LibraryDirectories : additional directories in which to search for referenced library files.
                        (default: {})

   Defines : list of defined symbols (either 'name' or 'name=value' strings)
             (default: {})

   Renaming : cell array of {sourcefile,identifier,sourcefile,identifier, ...} indicating that 
              the MEX functions generated from the respective source files should be renamed to 
              the given identifiers. Corresponds to MEX's -output option; does not apply to Java files.
              (default: {})

   Arguments : miscellaneous compiler arguments (default: {})
               For possible arguments, type &quot;help mex&quot; in the command line

   DebugBuild : whether to build binaries in debug mode (default: false)


   --- user messages ---

   ErrorMessage : the detail error message to display which describes what type of functionality
                  will not be available (if any).
                  Note: If you have a MATLAB fallback, mention this in the error message.

   PreparationMessage : the message that will be displayed before compilation begins.
                        (default: {})

   Verbose : whether to display verbose compiler outputs (default: false)


   --- misc options ---

   MathworksLibs : whether to use the Mathworks versions of std. libraries instead of OS-supplied 
                   ones, if present (applies to blas and lapack) (default: true)

   DebugCompile : debug the compilation process; halts in the directory prior to invoking mex
                  (default: false)


 Examples:
   % try to compile all mex / Java files in a given directory:
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources');

   % as before, but restrict the set of identifiers to compile to a given set
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources','Identifiers',{'svmtrain','svmpredict'});

   % try to compile mex / Java files in a given directory, and include 2 libraries in the compilation
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources','Libraries',{'blas','lapack'});

   % like before, but this time include additional source files from two other directories
   % (the single '*' means: include non-mex sources in the specified directory)
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources','SupportFiles',{'*','../blas/*.c','../*.cpp'});

   % like before, but this time add an include directory, a library directory, and some library
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources', 'IncludeDirectories','/boost/include','LibraryDirectories','/boost/lib','Libraries','boost_date_time-1.44');

   % like before, this time specifying some custom #define's
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources','Defines',{'DEBUG','MAX=((a)&gt;(b)?(a):(b))'});


 Use cases:
   1) In addition to a source file mysvd.c (compiling into mysvd.mex*), a stub .m file of the same
   name can be placed in the same directory, which contains code to compile the binary when needed.

   function [U,S,V] = mysvd(X)
   if hlp_trycompile
       [U,S,V] = mysvd(X);
   else
       % either display an error message or implement some fallback code.
   end

   2) In a MATLAB function which makes use of a few mex files, ensure compilation of these files.
   function myprocessing(X,y)
   if ~hlp_trycompile('Identifiers',{'svmtrain.c','svmpredict.c'})
       error('Your binary files could not be compiled.');
   else
       m = svmtrain(X,y);
       l = svmpredict(X,m);
       ...
   end

   3) In a startup script.
   hlp_trycompile('Directory','/Extern/MySources');
