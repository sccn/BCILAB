<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Acquire workers on some remote machines and return hostnames and ports of those that are available.
 Pool = par_getworkers_ssh(Hostnames,ProcessorsPerNode,MatlabThreads,StartupCommand,ShareResources,SharingPort,LoggingPath,IdentityFile,BinaryWorker,BinaryNmae,MatlabCompilerRoot,MinFreeMemory,MaxCPULoad,LoadWindow,AvoidProcess,RecruitMachines,VerboseOutput)

 This function attempts to ensure that the desired number of worker processes on remote machines
 is available for participating in distributed computations. Such computations are usually being
 submitted in the form of tasks to the respective worker processes, via the function par_schedule.

 Alternatively, the workers can also be started manually on the remote machines (this is the 
 recommended way if Windows machines are involved or use of SSH is not permitted) and their names
 would then just be listed in the cluster settings (rather than to configure acquisition behavior).

 In:
   --- what shall be acquired ---

   Hostnames : cell array of hostnames on which to acquire workers (duplicates and port assignments
               will be ignored).

   ProcessorsPerNode : number of processes to acquire per node; 0 means as many as there are cores
                       on each node, divided by the value of the 'matlabthreads' parameter
                       (default: 0)

   MatlabThreads : assumed number of threads per MATLAB instance (default: 4)

   --- how shall it be acquired ---

   StartupCommand : startup command, if any; if binary_worker is true, this is a sequence of shell 
                    commands, otherwise it is a sequence of MATLAB statements which contain the
                    placeholder %d where the TCP port # would be inserted; If the startup_command
                    is passed as 'autogenerate', a bcilab-specific startup command will be
                    generated (default: 'autogenerate')

   ShareResources : whether worker that are already running will be returned as part of the worker 
                    set, and are thus potentially shared with other users. If false, the requested
                    number of workers will always be started and be private to the requester -
                    however, potentially over-subscribing the node. (default: true)

   SharingPort : the starting port for shared workers; if 0, this is a hash of the startup_command 
                 (default: 0)

   --- associated files ---

   LoggingPath : default logfile path; make sure that this does not conflict with other users' log 
                 paths. (default: '')

   IdentityFile : SSH identity file, if needed (implying the -i option for ssh) (default: '')
   
   --- optional binary worker support ---

   BinaryWorker : whether to use assume a binary worker implementation rather than the MATLAB 
                  worker (default: false)

   BinaryName : name of the worker binary (default: 'build')

   MatlabCompilerRoot : installation path of the MATLAB compiler runtime; if empty, a few locations 
                        will be searched for an MCR that corresponds to the MATLAB version that is
                        running this function. If nothing is found, it is assumed that the MCR has
                        been installed into the system path  and is found automatically. (default: '')

   --- exclusion criteria ---

   MinMemory : minimum memory (in bytes) that needs to be available for an instance to be started 
               (default: 4GB)

   MaxCPULoad : maximum acceptable average CPU load (summed over all cores) for a node to be 
                considered (default: Inf)

   LoadWindow : CPU load measurement window, in minutes; can be 1, 5 or 15 (default: 15)

   AvoidProcess : avoid nodes with the given process running (default: 'avoidme')

   ShutdownTimeout : if non-zero, the worker will shut itself down if it has not received a
                     heartbeat signal from a client in the given time, in seconds. (default: 0)

   RecruitMachines : whether to recruit other machines, rather than just list them (default: true)


   --- misc ---

   HarvestTimeout : Harvesting timeout. This function will attempt to harvest process id's from the 
                    workers until this timeout has expired (in which case the pid of straggers will
                    not be known). Note that when multiple MATLABs try to launch simultaneously, it
                    can take longer than normal. (default: 300)

   VerboseOutput : whether to show verbose outputs during acquisition (default: true)


 Out:
   Pool : cell array of 'hostname:port' strings specifying the list of available machines
          Note: in the case that no return value is requested, the global variable 
                tracking.parallel.pool will receive this result. This is the recommended way to
                use par_getworkers_ssh, as par_schedule uses this pool by default.

  Logpaths : cell array of file paths of the logfiles corresponding to the workers in pool


 Notes:
   If workers are shared between users, code which maintains global state (in particular
   user-specific configuration options) may show unexpected behavior, as these variables are not
   duplicated across users.

   This function works only across POSIX-compliant (Unix/Linux/Mac) systems. On standard Windows
   workstations, the workers must be started manually (unless POSIX emulation software is
   installed).

 Examples:
   % acquire workers on the three hosts (assuming bcilab is in the same file-system location remotely as here)
   par_getworkers_ssh({'machine1','machine2','machine3'})

   % try to start fast pre-compiled workers (assuming bcilab is in the same file-system location remotely as here)
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'binary_worker',true)

   % MATLAB version again, also setting a custom logging path
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/')

   % like before, but this time only consider machines that have at least 8GB of free RAM and at most 10% CPU load
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/', 'min_memory',2^33, 'max_cpuload',0.1)

   % like before, but measuring the CPU load within the last minute (instead to 15 minutes)
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/', 'min_memory',2^33, 'max_cpuload',0.1, 'load_window',1)

   % acquire workers on the three hosts, this time using a custom startup command (the %d is where the port goes)
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'},'startup_command','cd path/to/bcilab/; bcilab(''myconfig'',''worker'',{%d,1}')

   % try to start fast pre-compiled workers (instead of entire MATLAB sessions); note that the 
   % startup command is this time a UNIX shell command which CD's into the directory where the run_build.sh is located
   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'binary_worker',true, 'startup_command','cd path/to/bcilab/build/distrib')
