 Signal = flt_clean_channels(Signal,MinCorrelation,IgnoredQuantile,WindowLength,MaxBrokenTime,Rereferenced)

 This is an automated artifact rejection function which ensures that the data contains no channels
 that record only noise for extended periods of time. If channels with control signals are
 contained in the data these are usually also removed. There are two threshold criteria: one is a
 minimum required correlation between a channel and a surrogate of it calculated from its neighbors
 using spline interpolation (calculated in a manner that is robust to bad channels in the
 neighborhood) and the other is a maximum tolerated noise level in standard deviations relative to
 the remaining channels (also robust).

 In:
   Signal          : Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. &gt;0.5Hz or
                     with a 0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band).

   CorrelationThreshold : Correlation threshold. If a channel is correlated at less than this value
                          to its reconstruction from other channels, it is considered abnormal in
                          the given time window. Note that this method can only be used when
                          channel locations are available. (default: 0.8)

   LineNoiseThreshold : If a channel has more line noise relative to its signal than this value, in
                        standard deviations from the channel population mean, it is considered abnormal.
                        (default: 4)


   The following are &quot;detail&quot; parameters that usually do not have to be tuned. If you can't get
   the function to do what you want, you might consider adapting these to your data.
   
   NumSamples : Number of RANSAC samples. This is the number of samples to generate in the random
                sampling consensus process. (default: 50)

   SubsetSize : Subset size. This is the size of the channel subsets to use, as a fraction of the
                total number of channels. (default: 0.25)

   WindowLength    : Length of the windows (in seconds) for which correlation is computed; ideally
                     short enough to reasonably capture periods of global artifacts or intermittent 
                     sensor dropouts, but not shorter (for statistical reasons). (default: 5)
 
   MaxBrokenTime : Maximum time (either in seconds or as fraction of the recording) during which a 
                   retained channel may be broken. Reasonable range: 0.1 (very aggressive) to 0.6
                   (very lax). (default: 0.4)

    ProtectChannels : list of channel names (cell array) that should be protected from removal. 
                     (default: {})


 The following arguments are deprecated but retained for backwards compatibility:

   Rereferenced    : Whether the measures should be computed on re-referenced data. This can improve 
                     performance in environments with extreme EM noise, but will decrease robustness 
                     against individual channels with extreme excursions. (default: false)

   LineNoiseAware : Whether the operation should be performed in a line-noise aware manner. If enabled,
                    the correlation measure will not be affected by the presence or absence of line 
                    noise. (default: true).

   MinCorrelation  : Minimum correlation between a channel and any other channel (in a short period 
                     of time) below which the channel is considered abnormal for that time period.
                     Reasonable range: 0.4 (very lax) to 0.6 (quite aggressive). (default: 0.5). 
                     
   IgnoredQuantile : Fraction of channels that need to have at least the given MinCorrelation value
                     w.r.t. the channel under consideration. This allows to deal with channels or
                     small groups of channels that measure the same noise source, e.g. if they are
                     shorted. If many channels can be disconnected during an experiment and you
                     have strong noise in the room, you might increase this fraction, but consider
                     that this a) requires you to decrease the MinCorrelation appropriately and b)
                     can make the correlation measure more brittle. Reasonable range: 0.05 (rather
                     lax) to 0.2 (very tolerant re disconnected/shorted channels).The default is
                     0.1.

 Out:
   Signal : data set with bad channels removed

 Examples:
   % use with defaults
   eeg = flt_clean_channels(eeg);

   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the IgnoredQuantile defaults
   eeg = flt_clean_channels(eeg,0.7,0.15);

   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the MaxIgnoredTime, using name-value pairs
   eeg = flt_clean_channels('Signal',eeg,'MinimumCorrelation',0.7, 'MaxBrokenTime',0.15);

   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the MaxIgnoredTime, using name-value pairs 
   % in their short forms
   eeg = flt_clean_channels('signal',eeg,'min_corr',0.7, 'max_broken_time',0.15);
