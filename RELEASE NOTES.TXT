This is BCILAB version 1.1-beta.
The latest versions of the toolbox can be found at ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/bcilab.

=== Getting Started ===

* Make sure that you have extracted this folder to a place that is not in your EEGLAB folder (an optimized edition of EEGLAB is bundled with the release).

* Start MATLAB, and if you have things in your path, reset you path to default settings by clicking File / Set Path / Default, and then Save. 
  If you have misc toolboxes in your path, you run the risk of creating unexpected errors (due to name conflicts), 
  but you can add your directories back later once you know what outputs to expect. If you intend to add BCILAB to the path, do *not* include sub-directories.

* Enter in MATLAB's command line: cd('your/path/to/bcilab'); bcilab; (if you path contains no spaces, you may also type: cd your/path/to/bcilab; bcilab)
  On some platforms (especially Linux), code for some advanced features will be compiled on the fly. 
  If you are using a compiler that is not recognized by MATLAB, you will get a few warnings here that you can ignore unless 
  you intend to use that particular device or component. 

* If you are a method developer, the best way to get into the toolbox is to start with the tutorial scripts in the userscripts folder
  (tutorial_erd1, tutorial_erd2, tutorial_erp1, tutorial_batch). They illustrate how to set up and run (currently over 40) different computational 
  approaches and exercise a large fraction of the available components. Then, the next step is to explore the GUI, which can help setting up approaches
  and analyses quickly. There is a GUI walkthrough video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sup2SaJyFQE Then, explore the method directories code/filters, 
  code/machine_learning, and code/paradigms, and remaining folders in code; for further clarification the accompanying video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3xIOopji28 
  explains the main concepts and data structures in the toolbox.

  If you are interested in experimental sciences or in data analysis and have prior experience with brain-computer interfacing, it is best to start 
  with the GUI walkthrough video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sup2SaJyFQE and then to run the tutorial scripts in the userscripts folder. 
  The lecture http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3xIOopji28 contains further details on toolbox concepts. If you want to get started with online analysis right away 
  and your hardware is not listed in the data acquisition menu of BCILAB, also watch the video on the lab streaming layer at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1at7yrcFW0
  To get an overview of the contained methods, browse the Help menu or read the code documentation in code/filters, code/machine_learning, and code/paradigms.

  If you are just starting out with brain-computer interfacing, take a look at the video lecture series accompanying BCILAB, which is at
  http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Introduction_To_Modern_Brain-Computer_Interface_Design -- you will want to at least watch the video for Demo 2, and any other
  videos coming before that. If you find the material overwhelming, take your time to digest it step by step and closely study the paper references and 
  researcher web pages that are discussed in the last module (Further Reading). If you have an interest in general biosignal analysis (not just brain signals),
  don't miss the video on Demo 1.

=== Finding Documentation ===

* There is a video lecture series with toolbox demo videos (particularly Demo 2) and theory lectures covering several of the methods at: 
  http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Introduction_To_Modern_Brain-Computer_Interface_Design

* Each component and function of the toolbox is documented individually, including the internal functions. This help is accessible through the Help menu, 
  adding up to 100-200 pages of text. This covers nearly all of the functionality and inner workings of the toolbox in a "bottom-up" fashion. 
  The key functions and components of BCILAB also each have a list of short scripting examples that may provide additional in-depth help (together >200). 

* If all else fails, the code of each function is documented fairly extensively and to a high standard. 
  Thus, if you run into errors, the first place to look besides the error message is the documentation around the place where it happened and the 
  documentation of the responsible functions. To understand the inner workings of the toolbox one would probably need to read about 20% of the 
  function-level documentation (and to fully understand all aspects of BCILAB there is currently no better way than glancing over 
  some of the code-level documentation).

* If you implement your own plugins (e.g. filters, machine learning methods, BCI paradigms, device I/O), 
  you basically have to look at how the other components of the respective type are written and take a look at the documentation for 
  the toolbox features that they are using (e.g., the arg system or declare_properties). Most of them serve as working examples of how
  to build own components for the toolbox. 

* There is a relatively up-to-date wiki for BCILAB, which tries to give a conceptual top-down overview of how some 
  pieces of the toolbox work together and digs down into how to write certain types of plugins (sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BCILAB). 
  Although it is perhaps the most readable document, this wiki currently covers only ~20% of the toolbox functionality (not even talking about particular methods). 
  Turning this into a complete documentation is currently not within our reach in terms of manpower.
  
* There are slides of recent talks on the toolbox (some on on earlier versions) including some theory in ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/bcilab/presentations. 
  It is best to start with the most recent one as the slides have evolved somewhat over time. An early workshop talk on BCI is available on video at: 
  http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/12th-eeglab-workshop/eeg-classification-and-cross-validation-using-the-bcilab-toolbox-overview

* We are currently writing a subsystems manual, which is ca. 20% complete. You find it at ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/bcilab/manuals.

=== Supported Platforms ===

* BCILAB should run on Windows/Linux/Mac, 32/64bit, MATLAB 2008a-2012a (and possibly newer)

* There are also compiled executables included for Win64 and Linux64 included, others forthcoming, (in the sub-directory build/distrib) which only require the 
  redistributable MATLAB Compiler Runtime (see http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html or ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/MCR for download links). 
  These are fully featured, but cannot be further extended through custom plugins (to do this you need a MATLAB license).

* This release adds a new plugin for general-purpose data acquisition from a variety of EEG (and other) devices by allowing to stream data from and to the lab
  streaming layer (LSL). LSL is a new signal transport, synchronization and collection system that is maintained independently of BCILAB at
  code.google.com/p/labstreaminglayer. Besides this, the toolbox continues to natively support BioSemi and BrainProducts hardware, as well as a few common 
  protocols (TCP, OSC, etc.).

Major Changes:
- arg_tovals: now by default sets the arg_direct flag to false rather than true, meaning that some 
  existing functions taking outputs generated via arg_tovals will likely run the slow path unless the 
  flag is set to true explicitly (e.g., via arg_setdirect)
- set_chanid is now case insensitive at channel matching (note that this should only break
  processing of pathological data sets which have multiple channels with the same name but 
  different case, and otherwise improve things)
- some methods are now marked as “experimental” and not shown in the GUI by default (can be 
  toggled at startup or in the bcilab_config.m)

Minor Changes:
- utl_fileinfo: now returns the version identifier string for the given file if one is present as the first 
  argument instead of the code hash (otherwise returns the hash as before); the 5th output 
  always contains the code hash
- set_fit_dipoles now stores dipole fits in a different format in the temp directory (now using 
  hlp_diskcache)
- channels with numerical labels are now assumed to be of type ‘EEG’ (instead of ‘unknown’)
- set_fit_dipoles: SCCN cap labeling schemes were updated to assume a priori that the most 
  recent (2012) cap scheme was used

- flt_clean_channels: minor changes to default settings
- flt_clean_flatlines: now uses a different criterion (based on duration of near-absolute flatlines);    
  the old functionality has been deprecated
- the helpers, misc, arg and parallel functions are now included under the BSD license
- io_loadset: the ‘nofixups’ parameter has been deprecated
- vis_hist: superseded by vis_artifacts
- ult_resolve_streams: matching of channel names and types is now case insensitive
- utl_add_online: some error messages are now lazy, so come up only when used erroneously 
  online
- flt_ica: normalizing the weights is now optional and disabled by default
- flt_fir: now uses the frequency sampling method by default
- set_makepos: improved how this function performs its online behavior (checks via onl_isonline)
- onl_predict: streamlined/simplified implementation; now calls onl_filtered to perform the signal 
  processing part
- onl_filtered: streamlined/simplified implementation; now calls onl_peek to read from raw 
  stream, also improved the documentation
- onl_peak: generalized a little bit (to support the needs of onl_filtered)
- io_loadset, set_new: now by default append a .tracking.timeseries field
- onl_newstream: reduced default online buffer length from 30 to 10 seconds, for faster processing
- some speedups in the online pipeline (simplified a few things)
- flt_ica: if TransformData is checked, by default the .icaweights field is cleared afterwards (can be disabled by 
  setting the ClearAfterTransform flag to false)
- ParadigmSpectralmeans: now uses a FIR filter by default instead of IIR


Serious Fixes:
- ml_calcloss: fixed calculation of FP and FN (Dan Roberts)
- utl_crossval: calculated mean AUC loss incorrectly, usually pessimistically
  (per-fold AUC’s were correct)

- arg_subtoggle: now properly supports ‘off’ / ‘on’ strings in the defaults
- env_showmenu: now highlights the menu when it’s already open
- env_beginfun: now uses a better way to measure the evaluation time of the function
- hlp_superimposedata: now supports all-empty inputs
- hlp_struct2varargin: now support empty inputs
- hlp_deserialize: fixed support for cell arrays of empty (0x0) struct arrays (crashed before)
- hlp_deserialize: now warns if a scoped/nested function could not be deserialized
- hlp_fingerprint: now respects the workspace of anonymous functions
- hlp_microcache: now warns if an improper lambda-equality value setting was passed in
- hlp_cryptohash: now does not overrun MATLAB’s Java heap when hashing large data 
- set_merge, set_combine and set_gettarget now accept empty inputs
- ml_calcloss: fixed typo in negative log-likelihood loss (crashed before)
- utl_resolve_streams: fixed a case where channel labels don’t match but the stream has the 
  right number of channels (didn’t work before)
- utl_memoize_commit: now gracefully handles the case where free drive space cannot be queried
- flt_resample: fixed Lanczos window (was off by one point)
- ParadigmSpectralmeans: fixed an off-by-one error in frequency indexing (Dan Roberts)
- flt_eog: fixed bug which disabled regression when removing EOG channels
