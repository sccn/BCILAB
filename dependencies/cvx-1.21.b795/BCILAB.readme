This toolbox is an essential dependency of BCILAB, and is used to implement the majority of fallbacks if other libraries cannot be compiled for your platform.
If its test script fails while BCILAB is loaded, please check the website cvxr.com for an updated version; they usually have well-maintained and up-to-date binaries.
This is a minimally modified version of cvx -- the part that displays "To accomplish this..." has been removed from cvx_setup.
