0) HOW TO READ
==============

If you want to get started without further delay, then read section 1) below
and jump right to the examples in doc/index.html.



1) ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS
=======================

This collection of matlab programs implements and demonstrates estimation
and inference algorithms for generalised linear models.
While (MAP) estimation or equivalently penalised least squares estimation
is a standard tool in statics, inference is less widely used and in general
more tricky.
The two approximate inference algorithms are described in the papers

There are 6 code subdirectories: doc, inf, mat, pen, pls and pot.

doc/      contains an index.html file providing documentation. This information
          is also available from http://www.kyb.tue.mpg.de/bs/people/hn/glm-ie.
          Usage examples reaching from probabilistic classification, robust
          regression over nonblind deconvolution to MRI reconstruction can be 
          found here. Further details are provided in the developer
          documentation manual.pdf.

inf/      contains the double loop inference engine dli.m and code to compute
          Gaussian marginal variances i.e. the diagonal of a covariance matrix
          => see infEngine.m

mat/      contains the lazy matrix class; mat/@mat is the base class all other 
          classes are derived from and the two auxiliary functions cx2re.m and 
          re2cx.m allow to convert between real and complex numbers

pen/      contains the penalty functions pen*.m
          => see penFunctions.m

pls/      contains the penalised least squares (pls) solvers pls*.m
          => see plsSolvers.m

pot/      contains the potential functions pot*.m
          => see potFunctions.m

Before running the demos or any other part of the code, you should execute 
startup.m to add all necessary directories to your path. In Octave, you can also
use the .octaverc file.



2) ABOUT MEX FILES
==================

Some of the programs make use of the MEX facility in matlab for more efficient
implementation. Besides the L-BFGS minimiser, the wavelet transform mat/@matWav
rely on C/C++ code. The wavelet code should compile right after the first call;
if there are problems, see the help in mat/@matWav/private/fwtn.m.
If you do not have a compiler installed on your system, you might want to 
consult [2].

In order to use the L-BFGS minimiser , you have to compile Peter Carbonetto's 
"Matlab interface for L-BFGS-B" [1]. The challenge here is the Fortran 77 code.
We provide a Makefile suitable for Linux 32/64 bit and Mac whenever you have 
1) g77 
or 
2) gfortran
properly set up.

Under Ubuntu, you can achieve this by installing the packages fort77 and 
gfortran, respectively.

Compilation is done by editing util/lbfgsb/Makefile. In any case, you need to 
provide $MATLAB_HOME which can be found by the commands 'locate matlab' or 
'find / -name "matlab"'. You can choose between two compilation modes:
a) using the mex utility by Matlab                                     [default]
  provide $MEX, then type 'make mex'

b) without mex utility by Matlab
  provide $MEX_SUFFIX and $MATLAB_LIB, then type 'make nomex'

In Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, the libg2c library needed for both 1)+a) and 1)+b) is not
included per default. If 'ls /usr/lib/libg2c.*' does not list anything 
this is the case on your machine. You then whant to install the packages 
gcc-3.4-base and libg2c0 e.g. from
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/gcc-3.4-base and
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/libg2c0.
After installation, you have to create a symbolic link by 'cd /usr/lib' and 
'ln -s libg2c.so.0 libg2c.so'.

Compilation under Windows is rather tricky but there is a way [3] of doing it
as pointed out by Guillaume Jacquenot. Steps involved:
   * Install MinGW (including gfortran compiler) at C:\mingw
      * http://www.mingw.org/
      * If the target was Matlab 64-bit, we would probably need MinGW-w64 instead?
   * Download http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/, unzip at C:\gnumex, and create
     Fortran/C mexopts.bat files for use with MinGW.
   * Add C:\mingw\bin and C:\gnumex in the PATH and reboot.
   * Create and run pls/make_lbfgsb_gnumex_windows.m script (replace the 
     filenames for the mexopts.bat files accordingly).
   Other useful stuff:
   * MS Dependency walker (to debug missing DLL dependencies), links
     to download at http://www.dependencywalker.com
