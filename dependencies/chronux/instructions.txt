Instructions:


Place the matlab package anywhere on your computer and
add it to your matlab path. This can be done by pulling down the 
File tab in the Matlab editor. Make sure that you use "Add with
subfolders". For future use, you can save this path by clicking 
"save". Do the same for the data directory. This contains 
some LIP data used by the testing script testscript.m.

Help is available in the doc directory.
First read the help in chronux.m that discusses variables that
are used repeatedly by the library and the important issue of
units.
