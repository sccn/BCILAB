Terminates MPI execution environment 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPI_Abort(MPI_Comm comm, int errorcode)
</PRE>
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>comm </B><DD>communicator of tasks to abort 

<DT><B>errorcode </B><DD>error code to return to invoking environment 
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
Terminates all MPI processes associated with the communicator <TT>comm</TT>; in
most systems (all to date), terminates <EM>all</EM> processes.
<P>
<H2>Thread and Interrupt Safety</H2>
<P>
The user is responsible for ensuring that multiple threads do not try to
update the same MPI object from different threads.  This routine should
not be used from within a signal handler.
<P>
The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not
mean that all routines may be called without any thread locks.  For
example, two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the
same <TT>MPI_Info</TT> object concurrently.  The user is responsible in this
case for using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that
only one thread at a time makes use of this routine.
Because the <TT>MPI_Abort</TT> routine is intended to ensure that an MPI
process (and possibly an entire job), it cannot wait for a thread to
release a lock or other mechanism for atomic access.
<P>
<H2>Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <TT>MPI_WTIME</TT> and <TT>MPI_WTICK</TT>) have
an additional argument <TT>ierr</TT> at the end of the argument list.  <TT>ierr
</TT>is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
<TT>call</TT> statement.
<P>
All MPI objects (e.g., <TT>MPI_Datatype</TT>, <TT>MPI_Comm</TT>) are of type <TT>INTEGER
</TT>in Fortran.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <TT>MPI_Wtime</TT> and <TT>MPI_Wtick</TT>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <TT>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</TT> (for communicators),
<TT>MPI_File_set_errhandler</TT> (for files), and <TT>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</TT> (for
RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <TT>MPI_Errhandler_set</TT> may be used but
its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler
<TT>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</TT> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <EM>not</EM> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
possible.
<P>
